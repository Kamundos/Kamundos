# 🧚🏽‍♂️  Hi & Welcome to my GitHub profile!

**`Almost Data Scientist`**

I am a data science student at the University of Tennessee, where I am honing my skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I am passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and drive business decisions and my passion has led me to take on a research project under Dr. Jiagen He,CCI Research & Innovation, where the team is <a href="https://hbcumobility.cci.drexel.edu"> examining the effects of academic mobility in HBCU professors</a>. 

Here, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests in the field of data science. From predictive modeling to data visualization, I have worked on a diverse set of projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex problems and extract meaningful insights from data in various eCommerce, banking, real estate, healthcare, etc. 

**Some of the highlights of my portfolio:**


A machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company
A data visualization project that explores the relationship between crime rates and income in major US cities
An NLP project that uses machine learning to classify customer feedback on a e-commerce website
I am always looking for new and exciting opportunities to apply my skills and continue learning. If you have a project or problem that you think I can help with, feel free to reach out!

**👀 Outside of school I enjoy:**

- Writing: I run a blog [natlynn.com](https://natlynn.com), where I share tips about lifestyle living.\
- Voluntering: I volunteer at Women In Tech. \
- Eating carbs: All forms of bread and pasta are my life\
- 📚 Learning: Did I mention, I love expanding my knowledge bandwidth. Recommend me your favorite LinkedIN Learning Courses.

 <summary><h5>👨‍💻 Nat's Data Science Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my ds journey when I made the switch from engineering to data science late in my junior year in college because I couldn't see myself being anything else but as a data nerd (and it's seriuosly the best decision I've ever made). Ever since I've been playing catch up with not only my data science classes but also with my hard skills and I've relied on self learning to understand the data science field and get as much real world project analysis exposure as I could.
