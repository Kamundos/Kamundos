**`Almost Data Scientist`**

I am a data science student at the University of Tennessee, where I am honing my skills in machine learning, statistical modeling, and data visualization. I am passionate about using data to solve real-world problems and drive business decisions and my passion has led me to take on a research project under Dr. Jiagen He, CCI Research & Innovation, where the team is <a href="https://hbcumobility.cci.drexel.edu"> examining the effects of academic mobility in HBCU professors</a>. 

Here, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my skills and interests in the field of data science. From predictive modeling to data visualization, I have worked on a diverse set of projects that demonstrate my ability to tackle complex problems and extract meaningful insights from data in various eCommerce, banking, real estate, healthcare, etc. 
<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**🌱 Some of the highlights of my portfolio:**

- A machine learning project that predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company
- An NLP project that uses machine learning to classify customer feedback on a e-commerce website
- A data visualization project that explores the relationship between crime rates and income in major US cities

<p>&nbsp;</p> 

**👀 Outside of school I enjoy:**

- 👩🏽‍💻 Writing: I run a blog [natlynn.com](https://natlynn.com), where I share tips about lifestyle living. 
- Rock climbing: I have recently been introduced to rock climbing and I've enjoyed this as sport.
- 📚 Learning: As I'm still new, I love expanding my knowledge bandwidth. Recommend me your favorite LinkedIN Learning Courses.
